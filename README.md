# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.

# Michael Salisbury UCSD Coding Pre-work

## Description


My motivation for the project here was to learn more about coding methods! 
I built this project to help me better understand coding and create a study guide.
This project solves the problem of new coders being unorganized re studying. It provides a website to focus related efforts. During this project, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with related methodologies and techniques.

## Usage

This study guide allows one to review notes in each section. If one would like suggestions on where to start studying, open the Chrome Devtools by pressing Command+Option+I for Mac or Control+Shift+I for Windows. A consol panel should appear below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There, one will see topics covered during Prework and a suggestion on which to study first.
